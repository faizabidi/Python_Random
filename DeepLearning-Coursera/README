Deep Learning Specialization is a course taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera. 

It consists of 5 courses:

1) Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2) Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
3) Structuring Machine Learning Projects
4) Convolutional Neural Networks
5) Sequence Models
